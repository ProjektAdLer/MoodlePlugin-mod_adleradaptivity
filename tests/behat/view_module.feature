  As a student
  In order to see my progress in the adaptive module
  I need the module to show the current progress of the module, tasks and questions

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email               |
      | student  | Student   | One      | student@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user    | course | role    |

      | Task1 | 100                 |
      | Task2 | null                |
    And the following adleradaptivity questions are added:

#      | 2    | False    |
#    And I follow "Review"
#    Then I should see "‚ùå This module is not completed yet"
    Then I should see a ".behat_module-failure" element
